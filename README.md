# Algorithms and Data Structures in Go

This repository contains various classical algorithms and data structures. They are all kept generic so you can
use them directly in your project.

## Aim

The aim is to implement generic portable data structures and algorithms. The goal is not to have an intricate relationship between
them, but rather to let you use small parts of this module without forcing you to embrace it all.
